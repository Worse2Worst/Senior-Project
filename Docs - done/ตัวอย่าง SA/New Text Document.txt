The scope of this project includes studying research papers from the past, researching and developing our own algorithm for the problem, simulating and running test cases. We will not intend to develop an actual mobile application in this project.
About the problem, we are trying to find the best ways to generate jobs for service providers (deliverymen); each job consists of request(s) from user(s) who want to send documents, given costs of traveling between places, time windows that users appoint to receive the documents, coordinates of places.  We want to generate the jobs with the lowest costs.
